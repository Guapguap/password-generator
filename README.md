Password Generator Assignment Week 3

## Description

Here is a short description about my thoughts looking into this project.

<strong>What was your motivation?</strong>
<br>
    -The main motivator when completing this assignment was the constant voice in the back of my mind telling to me that I can accomplish this new challenge.
<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -I built this portfolio for future employers and a personal tab for myself to refer back to and add anymore future projects. It is a great 'folder' to hold and view everything I've done in the past.  
<strong>What problems did I encounter?</strong>
<br>
    -I encountered several problems with this assignment. I noticed that my understanding of flexbox was not the greatest. Having to figure out how each property works cohesively with the container and children of the container was a challenge of its own. This project forced my hand to crack down and overcome these problems.
<br>
<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<br>
    -I got an overall better understanding of flexbox and how it works. I am at much more comfortable level when using flexbox. I learned through my tutor that it all comes down to trial and error. Keep playing around with the properties and eventually you will learn how it works. There is no point going into a tutorial 'hell' of trying to read and find the answer.
